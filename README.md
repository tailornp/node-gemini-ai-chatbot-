1. Open terminal in your desired folder
2. Run: git clone https://github.com/tailornp/node-gemini-ai-chatbot-.git
3. Run: cd node-gemini-ai-chatbot
4. Run: npm intall
5. Create an .env file in the root folder, add your Gemini API key as "GEMINI_API_KEY".
6. By default the port is set to 3000. To customize port add "PORT" in the .env file;
Note: You can obtain a free Gemini API Key from the Google AI Studio.
